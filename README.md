# POS-Tagging
The project does POS tagging on tagged brown corpus using Hidden Markov Model (Viterbi Algorithm) and CRF (Conditional Random Fields)

Accuracy of Viterbi Algorithm: 

F1-Scores (Number of Test Sentences Used = 10) :
              Precision     Recall    F1-Score    Support
Average/Total   0.935        0.925       0.925      239

Accuracy of CRF(Conditional Random Fields): 

F1-Scores(Number of Test Sentences Used = 10) :
              Precision     Recall    F1-Score    Support
Average/Total   0.961        0.958       0.957      239
