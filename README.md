# POS-Tagging
The project does POS tagging on tagged brown corpus using Hidden Markov Model (Viterbi Algorithm) and CRF (Conditional Random Fields)

Accuracy of Viterbi Algorithm: 

F1-Scores (Number of Test Sentences Used = 10) :

Precision - 0.935

Recall - 0.925

F1-Score - 0.925

Support Count- 239

Accuracy of CRF(Conditional Random Fields): 

F1-Scores (Number of Test Sentences Used = 10) :

Precision - 0.961 

Recall - 0.958

F1-Score - 0.957

Support Count- 239
